Python Class Methods, Decorators, and Advanced Topics
This repository serves as a collection of Python code examples and explanations focused on intermediate to upper-intermediate topics in Python. It covers essential concepts such as:

Class Methods and Static Methods: Learn the difference between @classmethod and @staticmethod, and when to use them effectively.
Decorators: Understand how decorators work, both at a basic and advanced level, including function and class decorators.
Inheritance: Dive deep into object-oriented programming with Python, exploring single and multiple inheritance, method resolution order (MRO), and best practices for designing robust class hierarchies.
Dunder (Magic) Methods: Master Python's special methods, like __init__, __str__, __repr__, __add__, and more, to make your classes more Pythonic and powerful.
